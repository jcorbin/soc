Stream Of Consciousness (SoC): is for the one holding the stake
===

It's a TODO list but:
- on a timeline
- with WIP item actions
- with Done item reflection

For status and a concrete example, see [`stream.md`](stream.md).

SoC is a system/tool to externalize or reify your Stream Of Consciousness:
- add and remember TODO items
  - ...elaborate or edit them as time goes by
  - ...may be pinned to a future date
- track current WIP (Work In Progress) items
  - ...taking notes within them as you go
- track Done items
  - ...enabling final notes on what was done
  - ...reflection and generation of follow on TODO items
- all of this happens on a date-stamped stream of days
  - the TODO/WIP/Done distinction primarily exists only within Today
  - past days contain primarily Done items
  - future days may be sketched with planned TODO items

Not SoC
---

SoC is not an issue/ticket/work tracking system:
- those systems are for stakeholders (at best) or managers (at worst)
- SoC is for the one holding the stake (the issue slayer?)
- SoC could be integrated with such a system...

SoC is not a personal wiki, knowledge-base, or zettelkasten:
- altho it could be a useful funnel/drafting-area for one
- reference content ( *cough* like what you're reading now *cough* ) can be
  intermixed with a stream ( head, tail, between days )
- a stream could be adjunct/linked to such an external brain...

Principals
---

It's just markdown, use your `$EDITOR`:
- the initial audience is programmers, who already spend a significant portion
  of their time within a text editor
- use of any `soc` tool or agent may enhance that, but cannot and should not
  replace the primacy of the user's chosen text editor

Items over time:
- the stream is fundamentally oriented around linear time
- which means that the primary focus is on the present: Today
- with secondary utilities for mining the past, and managing the future
